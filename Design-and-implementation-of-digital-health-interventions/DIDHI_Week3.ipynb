This is despite the **large appetite** for it from all stakeholders and a growing market. \n","\n","- The Nuffield Trust report provides an overview of the Digital Health landscape and analyses why it has been so difficult to deploy Digital Health technologies. Without careful implementation, a technology can have **adverse effects**, such as **creating inefficiencies**, **staff frustrations** and even **threaten quality of care** — rather than delivering the intended outcomes. Based on their research, the authors present seven key lessons to ensure the success of a Digital Health intervention, and these can be used to identify the associated challenges and barriers.   \n","\n","- Healthcare is complex and there are additional considerations that need to be made when innovating and looking to create or implement a health innovation — digital or otherwise. Many of these considerations are unique to the healthcare industry; they include:\n","  - the **need for rigorous evidence**\n","  - the **possibility of inflicting harm or death**\n","  - the **sensitive nature of health data**   \n","\n","- There are also important ethical, social, legal and political questions that are raised in Digital Health. The Wellcome Trust report is an excellent resource to help you think about the challenges of Digital Health. Though it focuses on artificial intelligence, the findings can be applied to Digital Health more broadly.   \n","\n","For the Nuffield Trust report, we suggest you read the executive summary and sections two and three of the report. For the Wellcome Trust report, start by looking at the summary (pages 5–8) and use the questions they highlight to help you think about the challenges in Digital Health — across the various subsets. These are explored in detail (pages 25–44) and illustrative scenarios are provided (pages 54–56) to further support your understanding of the challenges. \n","\n","**Reflection**\n","As you read the reports, keep the following questions in mind. You do not need to write the answers.  \n","\n","- List the different subsets that Digital Health encompasses and provide a short description for each one.

In turn, it is very difficult to deliver successful Digital Health interventions. Understanding the associated challenges and why previous attempts have failed can inform the development and implementation of successful Digital Health interventions.   \n","\n","- Healthcare systems are **complex**: they are **dynamic**, **unpredictable** and it is very difficult to predict how changes made in one part of the system will affect other parts of the system. \n","- The **NASSS framework** — which stands for **non-adoption**, **abandonment** and **barriers** to **scale-up**, **spread** and **sustainability** — was developed as a tool to identify and help address the emergent uncertainties and interdependencies of technology-supported innovation and change in health and care. The NASSS framework consists of **seven domains**: \n","  - the **condition or illness** (e.g. simple: ankle fractured, complex: dementia) \n","  - the **technology** (e.g. simple: already well developed; complex: not developed yet)\n","  - the **value proposition** (does the technology bring value to the patient? is it value for money? Most health technollogies are extremely risky) \n","  - the **adopter system (comprising professional staff, patient, and lay caregivers)** (really hard to persuade a patient to use a technology if they do not see a benefit; some staff do not want to feel like a data entry clerk)\n","  - the **organisation(s)** (a lot of new technologies now aim to introduce integrated care; however different organisations might not have any partnership established between them: one technology might make savings only for one organisation but not for the other)\n","  - the **wider (institutional and societal) context** (e.g. policy, regulation of technology, IG, public acceptance, acceptance from professional bodies) \n","  - the **interaction and changes over time** (how resilient is the organisation to internal and external changes? is the technology customisable and adaptable. If the technology can only do what it was designed initially to do, it is porbably not going to last very long).   \n","\n","- Each of these domains can be classified as **simple** (straightforward, predictable, few components), **complicated** (many components but still largely predictable), or **complex** (dynamic, unpredictable, many components). To maximise the success rate of technology-supported innovation, **complexity needs to be reduced in the technology and the organisation**. To do this, complex domains need to be pulled towards being simple or complicated instead.   \n","\n","- The NASSS framework is not a tool to be used mechanistically. Rather, it can help **identify and guide how to think about and address the complexities** in implementing technology-supported innovation and change in health and care. Furthermore, it can **aid in generating data** (both quantitative and qualitative) and it can help **prompt constructive conversations about how to reduce complexity**; in turn, these will support the successful implementation of technology-supported innovations and change in health and care.   \n","\n","- Next, you will hear more about the NASSS framework from Professor Trisha Greenhalgh, who led its development.

For example, it is very hard to predict what is going to happen (e.g. how one part of the system affects other ones).\n","- We need to 'unlearn' rational and logical approaches to change and implementation and start to learn from scratch how to do that in a complex system.\n","- The only way to **find out how a complex system works** is to **observe it** and in order to make progress you need to **constantly gather data** and understand what it means and **adjust your course of action accordingly**.\n","- Every aspect of a system can be divided in parts: **simple** (very predictable and very few components: e.g. making a sandwich), **complicated** (still logical and predictable, but with many components: e.g. building a rocket) and **complex** (things are unpredicatable, dynamic and constantly changing, e.g. raising a child).\n","- Because **health systems are complex** and each of them is different, we need a **different framework for looking at change** --> **NASSS framework**.\n","- It is not possible to decrease complexity in every domain (e.g. the condition/illness), but at least in some of them can make a difference.\n","- The NASSS framework cannot be used mechanistically. It is mainly aimed at prompting you and explore and think a bit more deep about some domains etc... It can be used as a self-assessing tool. Once you have identified an area of high complexity, you need to try and reduce it (e.g. does the technology need to be interoperable with other technologies? which are the domains for which complexity cannot be compromised).\n","- There is **no single solution to complexity** in any domain, **creativity** is needed and there is no really a technical fix.

Ongoing costs or failure to reap savings or return on investment can lead to the intervention being abandoned. \n","\n","*3) User perception*\n","Negative perceptions from the users can result in resistance to the intervention and a low interest in its success. Involving the users in the design phase to understand their needs and have them contribute to the development of the intervention can pre-empt potential barriers. This can also give the users a sense of ownership and secure buy-in — both of which are facilitators. Giving them an understanding of the benefits of the intervention is also useful — this can be communicated before implementation (e.g. presentation at the site, advertisement, written communication) or after (e.g. communications through champions or stakeholders, push notifications, repeating the method(s) used pre-implementation at intervals). \n","\n","*4) Evidence-base*   \n","A lack of high-quality evidence (scientific and qualitative) that the intervention works and can deliver the intended benefits is a barrier.

Examples of how to do this include ethnographic research, focus groups, interviews and testing as well as collecting ongoing feedback. Health literacy, interactivity and feedback are also important to consider.  Where possible, the intervention should be customised. A good example of a user-centred intervention is one that addresses a patient’s multiple needs or is interoperable with their existing technologies and care plans — this is especially useful for patients with comorbidities. \n","\n","*8) Security and privacy*   \n","Incorporate features that address security, confidentiality, how data is used and permission, and ensure that guidelines and regulations in the context are adhered to — for example, the General Data Protection Regulation for countries in the European Union and the European Economic Area.
